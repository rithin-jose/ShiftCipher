# CEASER CIPHER
The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is first necessary that both parties have the 'key' for the cipher, so that the sender may encrypt it and the receiver may decrypt it. For the caesar cipher, the key is the number of characters to shift the cipher alphabet.



## Installation
To install python is required  which can be installed form [here](https://www.python.org/),No other dependacies are required.

Clone the repository using:

	   git clone https://github.com/rithin-jose/shift.py.git
   
   and run the command:
   
	python shift.py


## Example
Here is a quick example of the encryption and decryption steps involved with the caesar cipher. The text we will encrypt is 'defend the east wall of the castle', with a shift (key) of 1.
> plaintext:  defend the east wall of the castle
> ciphertext: efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf
